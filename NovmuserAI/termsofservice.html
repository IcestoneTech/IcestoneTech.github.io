      <h2>14 Dispute Resolution.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any
            dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
            Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively,
            “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual
            arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated
            action or proceeding. You and NovmuserAI agree that the U.S. Federal
            Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these
            Terms, and that you and NovmuserAI are each waiving the right to a
            trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration
            provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (b) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 14(a) above: (i) we
            both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it
            qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or
            other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
            infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
            rights.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration
            will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
            under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in
            effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are
            available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who
            wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for
            Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified
            in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
            www.adr.org.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish)
            where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The
            parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to
            decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
            enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
            arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek
            to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible
            for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If
            we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and
            costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in
            arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
            expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section
            14(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability
            on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award
            declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual
            party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
            relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent
            that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief
            (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect
            of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the
            public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be
            litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
            arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of
            public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the
            merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND NovmuserAI AGREE THAT EACH MAY
            BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
            CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute
            is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
            another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
            preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
            this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the
            entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in
            Section 16(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an
            arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part
            of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these
            Terms will still apply.

      <h2>15. General Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            (a) Reservation of Rights. NovmuserAI and its licensors exclusively
            own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including
            all associated intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, NovmuserAI’s licensor, OpenAI LLC, exclusively owns all
            right, title and interest in and to Generated Content. NovmuserAI
            claims no ownership of Generated Content. You acknowledge that the
            Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of
            the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove,
            alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other
            proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the
            Services.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (b) Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and
            exclusive understanding and agreement between NovmuserAI and you
            regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all
            prior oral or written understandings or agreements between
            NovmuserAI and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these
            Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court
            of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the
            maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms
            will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer
            these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without NovmuserAI’s
            prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer
            these Terms, without such consent, will be null. NovmuserAI may
            freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject
            to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of
            the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (c) Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by
            NovmuserAI under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii)
            by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of
            receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (d) Waiver of Rights. NovmuserAI’s failure to enforce any right or
            provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such
            right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will
            be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
            representative of NovmuserAI. Except as expressly set forth in these
            Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
            these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under
            these Terms or otherwise.
